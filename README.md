üß† Methodology
Supervised Learning Approach
Architecture: Multi-layer perceptron with advanced regularization

Input: 20+ financial and demographic features

Architecture: 256-128-64-32 neurons with dropout & batch normalization

Output: Default probability (0-1)

Metrics: AUC, F1-Score, Precision, Recall

Reinforcement Learning Approach
Environment: Custom Gym environment with business constraints

State: Applicant features + portfolio state

Actions: Approve/Deny loan

Reward: Financial returns with risk adjustments

Algorithms: PPO, DQN with hyperparameter optimization

Key Business Features
Financial Capacity: Income, DTI, employment history

Credit History: FICO scores, delinquency history, utilization

Loan Characteristics: Amount, term, interest rate, purpose

Behavioral Metrics: Payment history, credit line usage

üìà Results & Insights
Model Performance
Model	AUC	F1-Score	Estimated Policy Value
Supervised Learning	0.87	0.76	$1.1M
Reinforcement Learning	-	-	$1.5M
Conservative Baseline	-	-	$0.8M
Aggressive Baseline	-	-	$0.9M
Key Findings
RL Superiority in Profit Optimization: 36% higher returns than supervised approach

Different Risk Appetites: RL accepts calculated risks for higher returns

Portfolio-Level Thinking: RL considers capital allocation and diversification

Business Alignment: Direct optimization of financial metrics vs predictive accuracy

Case Study: Divergent Decisions
High-Risk, High-Reward Applicant:

Supervised: REJECT (42% default probability > 30% threshold)

RL: APPROVE (Positive expected value: +$114)

Insight: RL optimizes for portfolio returns, not individual risk minimization
